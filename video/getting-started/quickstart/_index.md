## **Create an account**
For details on how to create a new account please check [Create a new Account](https://docs.aspose.cloud/display/totalcloud/Creating+and+Managing+Account).
## **Create an API Client App**
Before you can make any requests to Aspose for Cloud APIs you need to [create an API Client App](https://docs.aspose.cloud/display/totalcloud/Create+New+App+and+Get+App+Key+and+SID).

This will give you **App SID** and **App key (secret key)** which you can use to invoke Aspose for Cloud APIs.
## **Install the SDK of your choice**
Using an SDK (API client) is the quickest way for a developer to speed up the development. An SDK takes care of a lot of low-level details of making requests and handling responses and lets you focus on writing code specific to your particular project. Please check [Available SDKs](/video/available-sdks/) article to learn how to add an SDK to your project.
## **Make an API request from the SDK of your choice**
Use the **App SID** and **App key (secret key)** from the API app client you created in step one and replace in the corresponding code. Below is an example demonstrating converting video to one of the available formats.
