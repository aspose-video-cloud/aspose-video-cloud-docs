# **Aspose.Video Cloud SDKs**
Aspose.Video for Cloud is a modern REST oriented API, that allows easy integration into existing systems.
### **Why use an SDK?**
Using an SDK (API client) is the quickest way for a developer to speed up the development. An SDK takes care of a lot of low-level details of making requests and handling responses and lets you focus on writing code specific to your particular project.
### **SDK benefits**
Our supported SDKs are 100% tested and out of the box running. These SDKs are open source and have an MIT license. You can use them, and even customize them for absolutely free of charge.
